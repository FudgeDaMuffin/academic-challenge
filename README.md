Application for Academic Trivia Competition

To use, visit https://academic-challenge.com and create a game.
If you want to test with multiple players, join that match from multiple browsers or computers.
If you have friends to test it out with, send them the link too!

The site is intended to be used with Zoom, so the questions would actually be asked and answered over Zoom. This site handles buzzing in, assigning player roles, and keeping score.
